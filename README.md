Computational Pleating
======================

This repository contains the code for a workflow that converts Rhino model geometry into a format suitable for use in origami simulators. The original work was created for the Spring '20 Human-Machine Virtuosity: Hybrid Skill, Fabrication, and Design course at Carnegie Mellon University taught by Dr. Garth Zeglin and Prof. Joshua Bard. My teammates were Ryan Smerker and Ruohai Ge.

Our tool integrates traditional pleating and folding techniques into a digital design process. We used the excellent [Complete Pleats](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Pleats-Pleating-Techniques-Architecture/dp/1780676018/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=paper+pleating&qid=1623266145&sr=8-1) by Paul Jackson as our reference to folding techniques and representation. The .fold format was invented to be the common interchange format for computational oragami and therefore we chose it as the output format of our tool. Specifications and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/edemaine/fold). To view the .fold file we used the online [origami viewer](https://origamisimulator.org). The viewer can also export 3D geometry in STL and OBJ formats.

### The Tool

Each team member demostrated the tool by developing their own creative scripts to algorithmically generate fold patterns. Some results from my scripts are shown below. Check out the [report](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/16-455/s2020/1998/pleating-final-report/) for the great results produced by my teammates.

### Future work:
* Add the code that created examples of the geometry shown here and in the project report
* Package code as a Grasshopper plug-in and share on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en)
