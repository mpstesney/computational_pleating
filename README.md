Computational Pleating
======================

This repository contains the code for a workflow that converts Rhino modeling geometry into a format suitable for use in origami simulators. The original work was created for the Spring '20 Human-Machine Virtuosity: Hybrid Skill, Fabrication, and Design course at Carnegie Mellon University taught by Dr. Garth Zeglin and Prof. Joshua Bard. My teammates were Ryan Smerker and Ruohai Ge.

Our tool integrates traditional pleating and folding techniques into a digital design process. We used the excellent [Complete Pleats](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Pleats-Pleating-Techniques-Architecture/dp/1780676018/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=paper+pleating&qid=1623266145&sr=8-1) by Paul Jackson as our reference to folding techniques and representation. The .fold format was invented to be the common interchange format for computational oragami and therefore is used as the output format of our system. Specifications and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/edemaine/fold). To view the .fold file we used the online [oragami viewer](https://origamisimulator.org). 


### Future work:
* Add the code that created examples of the geometry shown here and in the project report
* Package code as a Grasshopper plug-in and share on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en)
